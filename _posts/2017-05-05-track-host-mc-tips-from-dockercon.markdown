title: Being a track host – tips from DockerCon
---

You've accepted to be a "track host," but you don't know how to do it?
Or you've done it before, but you'd love to swap a few tips, tricks,
and new ideas to do it better next time? I got you covered!

I've been a track host twice. Both times were for DockerCon, in the
"Black Belt Tech" track. I had a wonderful time, because that gave
me the perfect excuse to sit during the whole conference in a track
that was both fascinating and enlightening to me, and listen to
speakers of the highest caliber; some of them my friends, some of
them my idols, some of them both at the same time. I'll be honest
with you: the first time, I had no idea what I was doing. I knew
I was supposed to introduce the speakers and make sure that everything
went fine, but that was pretty much it.

This experience alone doesn't make me qualified to tell others how to
be good track hosts, or "MCs." However, I have spoken at conferences
*many, many times*. If we include meetups and internal presentations at
various companies, I have given more than one hundred talks over the
last couple of years. This gave me a feel of what worked (and what
didn't) as a speaker. When I started "MC'ing" at DockerCon, I tried
to have these experiences in mind, to turn them into useful teachings
to better do my job.

These tips and tricks are for the "day of." If you are also involved
in the program committee, speaker selection, and pre-conference
preparation – I have another post that I want to write about that;
but in the present one, I'm sticking purely to things happening
the day(s) of the conference.


## Before the sessions

This is going to sound silly, but make sure that you know when
your speakers arrive. Know how to contact them. (It could be
a phone number or any kind of instant messaging where you know
that they'll be responsive.)

Good speakers will typically check their room the day before;
but you can also setup a tour. Sometimes you have the room
sufficiently ahead of time to offer rehearsals in that room;
sometimes you'll just be able to show them what it's like.
This is important for the speakers: it lets them anticipate
the size of the room, how the audience will be seated, where
the screen is (or are). If there are multiple projector
screens, they'll know that they shouldn't use a laser pointer
(since they'll only be able to point at one screen at a time).
They should also be able to check if there is a mirror
screen, allowing them to see what they're projecting without
turning their back to the audience. That's also a good moment
to check that their computer (if they're using theirs) can
connect to the projector, and that they can connect to the
network (wired or wireless) if they need it.

I highly recommend to have a few video adapters. Most conference
projectors use HDMI connectors, and VGA is also pretty common.
But lots of laptops won't have these connectors, and will instead
use miniDP, or USB-C for recent models. Ideally, your conference
AV team should be able to provide a few adapters to accomodate
everyone. Ideally, you should tell your speakers "bring your
adapters." But eventually, you will miss an adapter. It's better
to realize that ahead of time than five minutes before the beginning
of a talk!


## The day of the talks

Make sure you know who the AV person is, so you can track them quickly
if anything goes wrong. Will they be in the room at all times, or will
they be here just at the beginning of each talk (to mic up the speaker)
and then they'll go away? In the latter case, it's a good idea to get
their phone number so that you can call/text them if there is a problem.

Check what type of mic the speakers will have (ideally, lapel or
over-ear); what type of mic *you* will have to make announcements;
if there will be an extra mic for Q&A. If some of the talks will
have more than one speaker, ask the AV team if each speaker will
have their own mic.

The AV person is sometimes knowledgeable about the lighting of the
room. If you want to feel over-prepared, inquire about that: what
should you do if the lights go off? Or conversely, if they go on,
making it harder to see the projector screen?

You should save yourself a few seats in the front row. The perfect seats
should be close to the stage or podium (so you can easily interact
with the speaker if needed), but also directly facing a screen (so that
you can take good pictures during the talk). It's often hard to get
both, especially in a room with two screens, one on each side, and
the speaker right in the middle.

It's also a good idea to save a few good seats for the speakers.
Write down (or print) "SPEAKER" in the middle of a few sheets
of paper, and place them on the seats that you want to reserve.


## Meeting your speakers

Ideally, you asked your speakers to be in the room 10-15 minutes before
the beginning of the talk, and to meet you on the front. It's time for
a few pre-flight checks!

First and foremost, confirm with the speaker the duration of the talk.
I know, that might seem weird; but some of us deliver a lot of talks,
and it can be hard to remember if your conference has 40/45/50 minutes
speaking slots, and whether that includes Q&A.

Speaking of Q&A, ask your speaker if they'll do one! Not everyone
does. Some speakers prefer to keep the whole time slot for their
talk because they have a lot of content to cover; some speakers
prefer to have their Q&A in the "hallway track." So check with them!

If the speaker will be taking questions at the end of their talk,
remind them that they should repeat the questions (unless you have
an extra mic for the audience to ask questions). This will make
sure that everyone hears the questions, and if the talks are
recorded, it will make sure that the questions are on the recording.

If the speaker has a "complicated" name (and by "complicated," I mean
something that you don't know how to pronounce), ask them how you should
pronounce it. Full disclosure: as a French person, the pronunciation
of english makes *no sense at all to me.* I mean, what do you expect
from a language where [ghoti and fish can be pronounced the same way?](
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghoti)
I expect that it's also true the other way around, since I'm
asked very often how to pronounce my last name (which is written "Petazzoni").
I'll tell you: I don't care how you pronounce my name. I got it
from my grand-father, who was Italian; but I was born and raised
in France, and I can't speak much italian, save for counting to ten
and a few expletives. Italians would pronounce it "pet-a-DZOH-nee,"
French typically go for "pet-ah-zoh-nee," but I mostly give talks
in english anyway, so I don't care. I will be slightly sad if you
write it incorrectly (e.g. "Pettazoni"), so I will give you a mnemotechnic
trick: it only has two Zs, like "pizza." I will also be slighty
sad if you mix it up (e.g. "Bertaloni", it happened), unless
you call me "Pizza Toni" with an overly heavy italian accent –
but in that case, you also have to pour me a glass of limoncello.
As a speaker, I will appreciate
if you ask me how to pronounce my name; and I will invariably
reply with an honest smile that it doesn't matter. Bottom line:
ask your speaker! I bet most of them won't hold a grudge if
you don't nail the pronounciation right, but they will always
appreciate you asking.

Ask your speaker how they'd like to be introduced. Same story:
they generally don't care (or rather, don't have anything specific
on their mind); but they might give you a hint about
what matters to them. If they work for a company doing something
particularly impressive, it's a good time to do some fact-checking.
For instance, recently I introduced [Brendan Gregg](http://www.brendangregg.com/), who
works for Netflix. I remembered that Netflix accounted for
about one third of the internet traffic of the US during peak
hours, but I wasn't 100% sure about that; so I checked with him.

If you can, try to find a little anecdote or story to introduce
the speaker. I personally try to find something fun or exciting.
It doesn't have to add to the talk (the speaker will take care
of that; not me!) so I just try to get people's attention before
the speaker begins. There is [some research](http://www.apa.org/monitor/jun06/learning.aspx)
showing that people pay more attention after they laugh;
so I aim for "funny" instead of "insightful" when introducing
speakers. They'll be the smart ones; not me!

If you're going to do some live-tweeting of the session (or
even just a few pictures), make sure you have their Twitter
handle.


## Just before the beginning of a talk

If the room is pretty full, and a bunch of people are standing
in the back of the room, there are a couple of techniques that
you can use to optimize resource utilization.

(1) You can announce that there are available seats and point
at them.

(2) Even better: you can invite people seated near the aisles
to shift away from the aisles. This will let people find
available seats easily, without having to disturb a bunch
of attendees to find a spot in the middle if a row.
(This technique was taught to me by the amazing [Bridget
Kromhout](https://twitter.com/bridgetkromhout)!)

A couple of minutes before the designated time, go on stage
(if you're not there already). Welcome the audience. If people
are talking and chatting, don't worry: when you'll start speaking
with the Holy Microphone, they'll go quiet. (I never had to
do "Shhhh!" or ask people to stop talking so far!) Then,
introduce the speaker. Their name, their title, the topic of
their talk; the small anecdote about them or their subject ...
And it's off to them!

Upping the social media game: if you feel like it, and if
the speaker is OK with it, now is the moment to take a great
selfie with the speaker and the audience in the background!


## During the talk

Now is the moment to listen to the talk and tweet stuff.
Insightful quotes, unexpected numbers or results, hot
takes, summary slides... Here are a few tips and tricks that I use.

- Use both your phone and laptop to tweet! The laptop
  is better for "text-only" tweets (because it's 
  much faster to type with a real keyboard), and the
  phone will be great for pictures.
- Always include the conference hashtag and the speaker's @ handle.
- Remember that you can put *multiple pictures* in a tweet.
  If a few slides go together, you can tweet them in a single
  tweet; or you can also tweet side-by-side a picture of
  a slide, and a picture of the speaker.
- Sometimes you can save a few characters by tagging the
  speaker on their picture, rather than mentioning them in
  text.
- Likewise, if at some point you need to mention a bunch of
  people or organizations, you could tag them all on a picture.
- Use threading when necessary.
- If you did a talk rehearsal, you will probably be able to
  anticipate the moments that are "photo worthy." Use this
  at your (and your audience's) advantage.
- If you have a copy of the slide deck, you can use it
  to tweet captures of the slides (instead of blurry pics).
  If you're using Linux, "scrot -s" is your friend; on OSX,
  Shift-Control-Command-4 will let you select a portion of
  the screen and copy it to the clipboard. You can then
  directly paste it (Command-V) when composing a new tweet.

Of course, you don't have to use *all* these tips all the time.
But I guarantee that they'll come up handy!

Last thing on the social media side: check regularly
for tweets tagged with the conference hashtag.
You can do that very easily, even if you don't use a
fancy Twitter client. Just enter the conference hashtag
in Twitter search, and switch to "live." Then, whenever
you see an interesting tweet (related to the session
where you are right now or anything else), retweet it
for reach. Even if you don't tweet much yourself,
retweeting other folks ends up having a significant
impact overall.


## The end is near

Five minutes before the end of the talk, if you see
that the speaker will probably run over, it's time to
flash them the helpful "FIVE MINUTES" sign that you
had printed in huge letters beforehand. Oh, you forgot
to print it? So did I. Every single time. Instead,
I take my favorite editor, put it full screen, and
type "5 MINUTES" with a huge font. Then I flash that
to the speaker. It usually works.


## Q&A

If there is a Q&A, you might have some housekeeping to do!

The easiest scenario is when there are mics on mic stands
for the Q&A. People will then line up behind the mic,
and all you will have to do is to intervene if there is
a risk of exceeding the alloted time. ("We are running
out of time, but don't hesitate to reach out to the speaker
after the talk!")

If there is no mic at all for the Q&A, make sure that
the speaker repeats the questions (especially if there
is a recording).

If the AV team gave you 1 or more extra mics for the Q&A,
if you are able-bodied, now is the perfect time to get
some exercise! You can run with the mic to hand it to
whoever is raising their hand. If your mobility is
reduced, or if you don't want to run around, get someone
to carry the mic for you, or keep the mic but repeat
the questions yourself.


## After the talk

Thank the speaker, ask the audience to give one more
round of applause. It's a good idea to tell the audience
how long it is until the next talk. If your conference
has a rating system for talks, remind people to use it.

Some conferences want to have the speakers' slides.
Some speakers don't turn out their slides ahead of time.
As a result, at some conferences, somebody shows up
right at the end of the talk to ask the speaker to
copy their slides on a USB stick. Give your speakers
some time to breathe!


## Parting words

I gave a ton of ideas, hints, things to do; but of course,
not everything will apply to your conference. You might
or might not be comfortable with some of the things I
mentioned here. So feel free to adapt as much as needed!
