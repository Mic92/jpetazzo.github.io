title: Yes, all men
---

In conversations about sexism (in the tech industry or
elsewhere), men are often surprised to hear how bad the
situation is for some of their women coworkers and friends.
We often are tempted to say "this wouldn't happen in my
company." If you are an expatriate or travel abroad,
there is also the variant "in my country, we treat women
fairly!" I would like to share something
that made me think twice about this.

A few years ago, I was invited to talk about "the future of
the cloud" at a tech event in Paris. This would be a 15-minute
 talk, with a very wide audience (both technical
and non-technical folks). That was something very different
from my usual mandate: back then, half of my talks were
"Introduction to Docker and containers" and the other half
consisted of more advanced topics revolving around containers
(containers and security, containers and microservices,
containers and immutable infrastructure, containers this
and that, you get the idea).

Just a few days before, [one of my coworkers](https://twitter.com/jessfraz) had published
a [gut-wrenching blog post](https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/this-industry-is-fucked/)
where she was describing the
daily harassment that she was facing. That woman was (and still is)
one of the best open source developers of my generation,
and back then, she was working on a very popular open
source project. And as a result, she was receiving a
constant stream of horrible emails and other messages
containing death threats, photoshopped pictures, and more.

Of course, not all women in the tech industry have to
deal with behavior as extreme; but sexism and bias is
rampant in our industry. [Women have to work harder
to get the same amount of credit](

we collectively have biases that [push women out of scientific
disciplines](
https://hbr.org/2015/03/the-5-biases-pushing-women-out-of-stem)
(as illustrated by the [story of this transgender man](
https://newrepublic.com/article/119239/transgender-people-can-explain-why-women-dont-advance-work
) who suddenly found himself way better considered at
work than when his name was Barbara). The software
industry, and open source in particular, is no better: far from
the "meritocracy" often advertised, open source communities
[don't welcome women](https://www.toptal.com/open-source/is-open-source-open-to-women
) and studies show that
[women write code that is at least as good as men, but
will be rated lower *if their gender is known*](
http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-35559439).

I'm French and spent the first 30 years of my life in France.
I became aware of the extreme sexism in tech only when I moved
to the US. Let me clarify: I am not stating that the US is
more (or less) sexist than France. I'm merely saying that I
was blissfully ignorant of the issue before. Obviously, I was
aware that in my CS degree, only 10% of the students were
women; but it never crossed my mind that women could have
a lower proficiency than men in the field. My mother was
a math teacher who used LaTeX to typeset the assignments
that she handed out to her students. My sister knew her
way around a Linux system (text mode, back then)
to access IRC and copy CDs.
My girlfriend in University floored me as we were
debugging code together because she could instantly spot
which pointers were on the heap or on the stack. 
The (few) women in our class back then were also in the top tier
of our alumni. And yet.

And yet, when I started to become aware of how rampant
and ubiquitous sexism could be, a little voice in me kept
whispering silently: "Not all men are like that. Look, in
France, you never saw anything like this happen." To be
honest, I didn't know – because I had never investigated
sexism in tech in France.

Until that talk.

I hadn't prepared anything for that talk. A few hours before,
I realized that I was completely unable to talk
about Docker for a non-technical audience. And as I tried to
chalk out ideas, to come up with colorful metaphors, I kept
thinking about my friend's blog post; about what she (and
possibly many other women) were facing.

So when I climbed on stage, I spent a few minutes babbling
not very convincingly about Docker, containers, and DevOps.
And then I tried to talk about sexism in tech. I don't know
if this was very convincing; honestly I don't even dare
rewatching that talk again because  I had slept two hours
that night and my performance was probably very poor. The
only thing I remember clearly is that I finished the talk
by saying, "my vision for the future of the cloud is as
follows: in ten years, on this stage, there should be
5 men and 5 women, instead of 1 woman and 9 men like today."

You Will Never Guess What Happens Next.

After my talk, *a lot* of women came to thank
me for "talking about it." That was quite surprising,
especially given the small number of women attending
the event. Statistics were at odds.
A few hours later, when I left the venue,
somebody who was sitting at a café across the street
even hailed me to chat about it.

I think it's about that time that the little voice
telling me "not all men" died in my head, because this
experience made me understand that even in France,
where we're all about "Liberté, *Égalité*, Fraternité,"
sexism is just as bad as in the US, and men
shouldn't try to pretend otherwise.

Next time you hear someone pretend that in their
school, university, country, region ... sexism is
"not as bad," think about this. Think about the fact
that women [cannot talk about sexism](
http://observer.com/2016/08/never-talk-about-sexism-if-you-want-to-be-taken-seriously/)
without facing negative consequences. So let's try at
least to change our discourse. If you say, "this doesn't happen
in my community," you are basically silencing anybody
who would like to say otherwise. Next time, try this
instead: "I'm sorry that this happened to you.
I wasn't aware of this problem. How can I help?"

One thing you can do is to [fight against your own biases](
http://www.aauw.org/2016/03/30/fight-your-biases/). One of my
favorite techniques is to deliberately apply reverse bias.
At a tech conference, *never* ask a woman, "so you're a recruiter?"
but try "so, are you rather in dev or ops?" If you are attending
a meetup full of dudes, and before the presentation starts, you
are striking conversation with one of the only women in attendance,
don't ask her if she works here. Instead, ask her if she's the
speaker. (I did once, and she was. True story!)
