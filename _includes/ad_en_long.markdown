This is the perfect opportunity to bring up the training
sessions that we're organizing in February 2019 in Canada!

There will be:
- [Getting started with containers](http://www.elapsetech.com/formation/docker-101#English) (February 25th in Montréal in English; February 28th in Québec in French)
- [Getting started with orchestration and Kubernetes](http://www.elapsetech.com/formation/kubernetes-101#English) (February 26th in Montréal in English; March 1st in Québec in French)

These sessions are designed to complement each other, so you
can follow both of them if you want to ramp up your skills
in containers *and* orchestration.

If you wonder what these training sessions look like, our
slides and other materials are publicly available on
[http://container.training/](http://container.training).
You will also find a few videos taken during previous
sessions and workshops. This will help you to figure out
if this content is what you need!
