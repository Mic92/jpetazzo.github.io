> In April, I will deliver three training sessions in Paris (in French).
> There will be [getting started with containers](https://enix.io/fr/services/formation/bien-demarrer-avec-les-conteneurs/),
> [deploying apps with Kubernetes](https://enix.io/fr/services/formation/deployer-ses-applications-avec-kubernetes/), and
> [Kubernetes administration and operations](https://enix.io/fr/services/formation/operer-et-administrer-kubernetes/).
> French is not your thing? I got you covered with
> [Kubernetes for administrators and operators](https://conferences.oreilly.com/velocity/vl-ca/public/schedule/detail/75313), a two-day tutorial
> in June, at the O'Reilly Velocity conference in San Jose (CA).
